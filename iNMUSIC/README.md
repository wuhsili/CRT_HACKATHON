Description:
    The inMusic application creates a virtual space to experience the music on the Rubbertracks sample library. A ‘stage’ is used to drop ‘nodes’ that contain individual stems of a song and arrange them in space. The user is then able to move on, around, and between these stems to manipulate the sounds.
 
    As the user approaches a ‘node’ it becomes louder and as one moves away it becomes softer until it gets out of range and cannot be heard. Stems are also panned in stereo depending on the orientation of the ‘nodes’ relative to the user. These qualities give the user the ability to ‘mix’ these stems through a spatial interface as opposed to traditional methods.
